# Identification of Defective Manufacturing Products with a Convolutional Autoencoder - Group Project
## Description

A manufacturing process inevitably generates defective products. The aim of our project is to identify these faulty items from the MVTecAD Anomaly Detection Database with unsupervised learning techniques. For this we are training a convolutional autoencoder on images that contain non-scrap products. Since the autoencoder only encounters correct products during training, it will reconstruct images of normal products correctly, but not the images of defective ones - as a result these will have a higher reconstruction error.
